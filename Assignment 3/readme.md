# Lexer for tinyC

## This is a guide as to how to use the lexer

### Note: Linux bash, gcc compiler, flex and make are required to get the program running

run ```make``` to generate the output.txt file which is the lexical analysis of the test c file along with the other files required to run the program

run ```make clean``` to remove the output.txt file and all the other files generated by the make command

for testing the analyzer in the terminal simply run ```./a.out``` and keep entering the input you want to test
